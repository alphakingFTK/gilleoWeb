                        <h3>NOTICE:</h3> We want to get this out of the way first, The “Partner Program” for 
                        Gilleo will be released in its third Phase.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This program will be titled "Creators Zone" for short “CZ”.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So please stay with us till we have everthing set in place to request for the program.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Creators Zone will be implemented for those who have been verified by the staff. NO exceptions. 
                        We have an early draft requirement for this, you can check it out below if the information is available.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h1 style="margin: 10px;"><b>Creator Zone (C.Z.)</b></h1>

                        <p>
                            Welcome Creators, this is a quick run down of futuer plans for the
                            Gilleo "Partner Program" and other information users may like to know of.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Gilleo will work to provide its best platform possible by an independent company. 
                            We will try to hold all rules listed in “<a href="termsofuses">Terms Of Use</a>” to the fullest for every user and Creators that we are here to serve. 
                            All videos must be uploaded within the guidelines provided in “<a href="uploadingrules">Upload Rules</a>”. As such no users will be treated and different by status or partnership if any violations are present.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To keep costs low and keeping the best possible experience on this platform, each year we will have a digital flush. 
                            That means any channels/videos with less than 500 following (or 15k views) will be removed from the platform from the previous year. 
                            Videos that are more than two (2) years (that have not received Verification/Partner Program) will also have the same outcome.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As we grow the time frame will grow but the year to reach will stay the same. You are able to apply for verification at 2k following if you have an active viewing of 5k a video.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As Gilleo grows the process of verification and earning commission from videos will be required to go through a set of qualifications to make sure everyone gets their chance. 
                            Below we have set some information that will be required, please keep in mind some more requirements may be added or change later-on to suit a growing need...
